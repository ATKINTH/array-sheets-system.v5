Branch protection recommendations for `main`:

- Require PR reviews before merging (1-2 approvals)
- Require status checks: `Verify Network & Scripts`, `Lint & Security`
- Enforce Code Owners approval (use CODEOWNERS)
- Require PR to be up-to-date with base branch before merge
- Restrict who can push to main (e.g., ops team)
- Enable required signed commits / GPG where possible
